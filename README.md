# Tiger-Moves
2 player board game originaly from Nepal called Bagh-Chal, played on a 5x5 grid, similar to a chess board. The app includes an assist feature that highlights all possible moves for a piece when selected, to help new players learn the rules. 

The game is played on a 5×5 point grid, like alquerque. Pieces are positioned at the intersection of the lines and not inside the areas delimited by them. Directions of valid movement between these points are connected by lines. The game play takes place in two phases. In the first phase the goats are placed on the board while the tigers are moved. In the second phase both the goats and the tigers are moved. For the tigers, the objective is to "capture" five goats to win. Capturing is performed as in alquerque and draughts, by jumping over the goats, although capturing is not obligatory. The goats win by blocking all the tigers' legal moves. Bagh-Chal has many similarities to the Indian game Aadu puli attam (goat–tiger game), though the board is different.
