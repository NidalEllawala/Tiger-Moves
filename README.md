## Tiger-Moves

Bagh Chal or Tiger Moves is a 2 player board game originaly from Nepal. 

### Rules
The game is played on a 5×5 point grid, like alquerque. Pieces are positioned at the intersection of the lines and not inside the areas delimited by them. Directions of valid movement between these points are connected by lines. The game play takes place in two phases. In the first phase the goats are placed on the board while the tigers are moved. In the second phase both the goats and the tigers are moved. For the tigers, the objective is to "capture" five goats to win. Capturing is performed as in alquerque and ------draughts, by jumping over the goats, although capturing is not obligatory. The goats win by blocking all the tigers' legal moves. Bagh-Chal has many similarities to the Indian game Aadu puli attam (goat–tiger game), though the board is different.

### How to use

- Your opponent can join the game using this gameId
- The scoreboard will keep track of the pieces and includes a turn indicator to let you know when the opponent has moved a piece
- A helper feature highlights all possibl moves when you click on a piece
